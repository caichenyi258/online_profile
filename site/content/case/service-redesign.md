## Background

Hotelbeds Group is a leading bedbank and a business-to-business provider of services to the global travel industry. It helps providers of travel services globally distribute their offerings to travel sellers. The group wants to redesign the dashboard their platform and also to merge the portals and to come up with a digital strategy which can better engage, activate and retain the community.

## Research process

Bedsonline.com. In China, we recruited 4 agencies to be our respondents, each of which represents a type of user. My role was to conduct the ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews in the office of these agencies.

We used multiple tools to collect data of the relationship of these agencies with their end consumers and try to capture the top trends of travel industry from the eyes of travel agencies. Together with the UX and UI designers, we had successfully transformed hotelbed’s service from solution based to knowledge based with the new structured website.
